Intorduction to the code (why I did this):

This code unlocks a memory of when I used to play outside with my friends. We always used to take a ball and kick it around for hours. I wanted to code something that was meaningful to me and I enjoyed doing.

About the code:

This code is an example of an animation of an object moving back and forth on your screen. There are many conditional statements included in this code that allow the user to interact with the code adn enjoy the outcomes of each action they are instructed to do. An example is when the user prsses their mouse and the ball will go a certain direction, however if the user clicks any of their keys, then the ball will go in another direction. There are instructions for the user on the screen that will instruction them on what to press or do. The instructions are timed so there will be no scenario where the user has no idea what to do.
